## Adding a template

Requirements for adding a template:

- Typically an entry can be added below another one in the same category as a new line with this content: `- [Template Name](https://github.com/username/repository/deploy.yml) - Description of the template.` when pointing to your own repository or `- [Template Name](./templates/template_name/deploy.yml) - Description of the template.` when having added the template to the templates folder.
- Make sure that your spelling and grammar for the description is correct, that the casing is as shown in the other list items, and that the description ends with a dot.
